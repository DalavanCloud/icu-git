# General options
# 
[core]
	# When core.shared is set to 'true', all files will be made group-writable.
	#
	# You MUST set this option to 'true' when more than one system account is used
	# to work with this repository (e.g. Apache for Subversion and SSH for Git).
	# All these accounts MUST then share the same primary group.
	shared = false

	# Path to the directory where logs are stored.
	logs = subgit/logs

	# Path to the authors mapping file or authors mapping helper program.
	#
	# There could be one or more authorsFile options specified. Options are processed
	# from the last to the first one specifed, until mapping is obtained.
	#
	# Option value could be one of the following:
	#
	#        text file with explicit authors mapping in git-svn format,
	#        that is described at 'http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-svn.html'
	#     OR
	#        path to an executable authors mapping helper program and its optional arguments;
	#        authors mapping helper program is expected to read data from the standard input
	#        and to provide output to the standard output. Input/output format is:
	#
	#        for Git to Subversion mapping:
	#               INPUT:
	#                FULL AUTHOR NAME
	#                AUTHOR EMAIL
	#               OUTPUT:
	#                SUBVERSION USER NAME
	#
	#        for Subversion to Git mapping:
	#               INPUT:
	#                SUBVERSION USER NAME
	#               OUTPUT:
	#                FULL AUTHOR NAME
	#                AUTHOR EMAIL
	#
	#        Sample authors mapping script could be found in 'subgit/samples' directory.
	#
	# When no authorsFile option is specified, automatically generated mapping will be used. 
	authorsFile = ../../scripts/authors.txt

	# Domain to be used to generate Git committer email when authors mapping
	# is not defined or does not provide email address for a particular committer.
	defaultDomain = svn.icu-project.org

# 
# Git mapping options
# 
[git "default"]
	# Path within Subversion repository to the root of trunk/branches/tags structure.
	translationRoot = /

	# Path to the Git repository.
	repository = ../../git/icu.git
	pathEncoding = UTF-8

	# Options below (trunk, branches, tags, shelves) define correspondece between Subversion
	# directories and Git references. Depending on the actual Subversion project layout and whether
	# all or only some of the branches have to be mirrored, these options might need to be adjusted.
	#
	#  Generic mapping syntax is:
	#    <Subversion-Path-Pattern>:<Git-Reference-Pattern>
	#
	#  Subversion paths are relative to the path defined by the git.translationRoot option.
	#
	#  Wildcard mappings:
	#    Use wildcard branches and tags mappings to define correspondence between set of Subversion
	#    directories that represent branches or tags and corresponding Git references:
	#
	#    branches = branches/*:refs/heads/*
	#    branches = branches/*/*:refs/heads/*/*
	#    branches = branches/*/project:refs/heads/*
	#    branches = branches/feature_*_2015:refs/heads/features/*
	#
	#    Wildcard related mapping syntax rules:
	#
	#    - Each mapping could include zero or more '*' on both sides (sides are separated by ':') of the definition.
	#    - Each path or namespace segment should contain no more than one '*'.
	#    - Number of '*' on the left side of the mapping must be equal to the number of '*' on the right side of it.
	#
	#  Explicit mappings:
	#    Use explicit mapping for the Subversion directory that represents trunk and optionally for
	#    individual branches or tags:
	#
	#    trunk = trunk:refs/heads/master
	#    branches = branches/1.0.x:refs/heads/1.0.x
	#    tags = tags/1.0.1:refs/tags/1.0.1
	#
	#  Shelves:
	#    Shelves are directories SubGit creates in Subversion repository to mirror Git anonymous
	#    branches to. Shelves mapping is optional, when unspecified anonymous Git branches will not
	#    be mirrored. shelves option defines location for those special branches:
	#
	#    shelves = shelves/*:refs/shelves/*
	#
	#  Excluding branches, tags and paths from translation:
	#     Mappings could be refined by specifying patterns that controls what branches and tags
	#     are excluded from the translation.
	#
	#     excludeBranches = SIMPLE_PATTERN
	#
	#     Value of excludeBranches option is simple path matching pattern, with zero or one '*' symbol.
	#     Branch path relative to the translation root path is matched against the pattern specified.
	#
	#     To include or exclude particular files or directories within any of the branches (including trunk and shelves) 
	#     or tags, use the following options:
	#
	#     excludePath = PATTERN
	#     includePath = PATTERN
	#
	#     Value of excludePath and includePath options is a pattern in format same to that used in .gitignore file.
	#     Only non-recursive patterns are supported by includePath option (pattern should start with '/').
	#     Paths being matched against the patterns are relative to the branch or tag path.
	#     See 'http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore' for complete documentation on the pattern format.
	#
	#     When branches, tags or paths are excluded from the translation with the help of one of the above options,
	#     modifications to those branches or paths made in Subversion project would not be translated to Git,
	#     as well as changes in Git repository made to those locations would not appear in Subversion.
	#
	# SubGit supports mirroring of Subversion projects that have no branches. To configure mirror
	# for such project do the following:
	#
	#    a) Define no mapping (no trunk, branches, tags and shelves options), and
	#       make sure that git.translationRoot option value refers to the project root folder
	#       in Subversion repository;
	#    b) optionally set trunk = :refs/heads/referenceName to override default Git branch name.
	#
	# Note, that paths in mappings are case-sensitive, i.e. trunk and Trunk are considered to be
	# different paths.
	#
	# Once defined, mapping could be extended (e.g. new branches could be added), but changes that
	# leave existing branches unmapped are not accepted.
	#
	# Mapping suggested by default reflects recommended Subversion project layout as described
	# at 'http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.importing.html#svn.tour.importing.layout'
	trunk = trunk:refs/heads/master
	branches = branches/*/*:refs/heads/*-*
	shelves = shelves/*:refs/shelves/*
	tags = tags/*:refs/tags/*

	# When 'git.keepGitCommitTime' is set to 'true', SVN commits will have the same dates
	# as corresponding Git commits, even if this violates monotonic increase of commit dates from revision to revision.
	# As a side effect some features that rely on dates order like 'revision dates' may work incorrectly
	# (see 'http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.tour.revs.specifiers.html' for 'revision dates' feature explanation).
	#
	# When 'git.keepGitCommitTime' is set to false, SubGit will try to preserve Git commit dates while translation to SVN,
	# as it is possible, but it will guarantee SVN dates to increase monotonically from revision to revision.
	keepGitCommitTime = false
